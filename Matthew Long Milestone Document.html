        <p>     Every project starts with an idea. Whether this idea is dictated by a superior in your company or your own passion project, any software needs an idea for what it needs to be. 
            But first, you need to know what it is it needs to be. You can't just start coding if you have no cohesive plan for what you're coding and how much coding you're going to do. 
            Having a proper list of requirements for your project is crucial for success. Various strategies and tactics for planning exist. </p>

                <li><H2>Approvement from employers:</H2><h3>Letting your superiors know what to expect is critical to not only finalizing he project, but keeping your job and making a successful commercial project.</h3></li>
                <li><H2>Understanding Priorities </H2><h3>Not every idea can make it into a project. Plenty of ideas will be scrapped for time, budget or creative restraints. Know your scope so that the project doesn't balloon out into something unacheivable.</h3></li>
                <li><H2>Writing Pseudo-code:</H2><h3>Pseudocode is rough code made for the designers alone. They're written in plain english to be as understandable and easily digestible as possible to detail what a project requires.</h3></li>
