        <p>You've got your idea, but can you make it a reality? Beleive it or not, you have to code to make a program. Besides knowing how to code, time management is crucial to making 
            sure a project is made in time. Coding is a complicated task that requires a lot of skill. But another component to coding besides skill is drive. Being able to keep at it for long 
            stretches, even though it's hard, is just as if not more important than raw skill. It's easy to get bored in the tedium of coding, so developing good work habits is key to getting any project done.</p>

                    different languages in the real world, there are multiple languages for coding. Different languages are suited for different types of programs. For Example, Python is a coding 
                language used to for Website Applications, Machine Learning Programs, Data Science and Game Production. Python is made to be as readable as possible. Others such as CSS and 
                Java Script are also used for game development, among other things. There are multiple more, and understanding your favorite is key.</h3></li>
