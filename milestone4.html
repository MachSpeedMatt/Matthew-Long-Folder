    <p>Before software is officially published, it must be licensed if you expect to get any money off of it. A software license is required to assure the legal fortitude of your creation.</p>

    <p>A software license is a legal term regarding the use of or redistribution of software. Under copyright laws, all software is copyright protected. Software cannot be copyrighted if it’s 
        made by the US government, or if it’s in the Public Domain. Properties can be entered into the Public Domain by the creator, but they’re automatically put in after a certain period. 
        Public Domain applies to historical works such as the Mona Lisa, and to properties with expired copyrights, such as The Great Gatsby. Interpretations and rereleases of these works can 
        be copyrighted and commercialized in and of themselves, but the original source material can never be copyrighted again.</p>

    <p>There are many kinds of Copyright and Licenses. As for Software Licenses, they have many all to their own. Depending on the license, the consumer is allowed different rights on what they 
        can and cannot do with their product. For example, the original DOOM demo was shareware, meaning that it could be shared among users for free. The full game cost money and could not be 
        shared. In another case, documents made using Microsoft Office Software are free to share, but money cannot directly be made off of them. In some of the most strict cases, unauthorized 
        use of licensed music often warrants an immediate copyright strike by the copyright holder.  </p>

    <p>From the strictest case of not allowing footage of the software to the free distribution of shareware, different licenses afford different leniencies to consumers. For example, Documents 
        made using Microsoft Office Software are free to share, but money cannot directly be made off of them. </p>
