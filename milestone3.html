    <p>     You've made your code. but there's an issue with it. It's infested. Digital termites are a common pest that afflict nearly every programmer. They eat and tunnel into the code, 
        negating all the hard work you've done. Unfortunately, only trained professionals can get rid of this infection: The Cyber Exterminators.</p>

        <p>In reality, bugs are not literal arthropods and there are no exterminators. Bugs are issues in code that cause seemingly random aspects to not work correctly. They're known as bugs for their pest-like annoyance.
            While they may seem random, each and every bug is a result of an error made by the programmer. Some bugs are are ants, some are giant isopods. Nearly every bug encountered is a logical or 
            typographical error.

            <ul>
                <li><H2>Insects:</H2><h3>Typographical errors are simple mistakes with <i>usually</i> simple fixes. You probably just forgot a bracket somewhere; go look for it. But alas, not
            everything can be so simple. Finding the origin of the error is often a long, convoluted journey. You may have to track down a series of tags just to find a missed backslash or a misspelling. </h3></li>

                <li><H2>Arachnids:</H2><h3>Logical errors are a bit more complicated than typographical errors. They require far more work than typographical issues, as whole sections of code 
                    may need to be altered. </h3></li>
            </ul>
