        <p>     Every project starts with an idea. Whether this idea is dictated by a superior in your company or your own passion project, any software needs an idea for what it needs to be. 
            But first, you need to know what it is it needs to be. You can't just start coding if you have no cohesive plan for what you're coding and how much coding you're going to do. 
            Having a proper list of requirements for your project is crucial for success. Various strategies and tactics for planning exist. </p>
            <ul>
                <li><H2>Approvement from employers:</H2><h3>Letting your superiors know what to expect is critical to not only finalizing the project, but keeping your job and making a successful commercial project.</h3></li>
                <li><H2>Understanding Priorities </H2><h3>Not every idea can make it into a project. Plenty of ideas will be scrapped for time, budget or creative restraints. Know your scope so that the project doesn't balloon out into something unacheivable.</h3></li>
                <li><H2>Writing Pseudo-code:</H2><h3>Pseudocode is rough code made for the designers alone. They're written in plain english to be as understandable and easily digestible as possible to detail what a project requires.</h3></li>
            </ul>

        <p>You've got your idea, but can you make it a reality? Beleive it or not, you have to code to make a program. Besides knowing how to code, time management is crucial to making 
            sure a project is made in time. Coding is a complicated task that requires a lot of skill. But another component to coding besides skill is drive. Being able to keep at it for long 
            stretches, even though it's hard, is just as if not more important than raw skill. It's easy to get bored in the tedium of coding, so developing good work habits is key to getting any project done.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><H2>Coding Languages:</H2><h3>This site, as with others, are written using what's called HTML. HTML is a coding language used to make websites such as this. But as there are 
                    different languages in the real world, there are multiple languages for coding. Different languages are suited for different types of programs. For Example, Python is a coding 
                language used to for Website Applications, Machine Learning Programs, Data Science and Game Production. Python is made to be as readable as possible. Others such as CSS and 
                Java Script are also used for game development, among other things. There are multiple more, and understanding your favorite is key.</h3></li>

    <p>     You've made your code. but there's an issue with it. It's infested. Digital termites are a common pest that afflict nearly every programmer. They eat and tunnel into the code, 
        negating all the hard work you've done. Unfortunately, only trained professionals can get rid of this infection: The Cyber Exterminators.</p>

        <p>In reality, bugs are not literal arthropods and there are no exterminators. Bugs are issues in code that cause seemingly random aspects to not work correctly. They're known as bugs for their pest-like annoyance.
            While they may seem random, each and every bug is a result of an error made by the programmer. Some bugs are are ants, some are giant isopods. Nearly every bug encountered is a logical or 
            typographical error.

            <ul>
                <li><H2>Insects:</H2><h3>Typographical errors are simple mistakes with <i>usually</i> simple fixes. You probably just forgot a bracket somewhere; go look for it. But alas, not
            everything can be so simple. Finding the origin of the error is often a long, convoluted journey. You may have to track down a series of tags just to find a missed backslash or a misspelling. </h3></li>

                <li><H2>Arachnids:</H2><h3>Logical errors are a bit more complicated than typographical errors. They require far more work than typographical issues, as whole sections of code 
                    may need to be altered. </h3></li>
            </ul>

    <p>Before software is officially published, it must be licensed if you expect to get any money off of it. A software license is required to assure the legal fortitude of your creation.</p>

    <p>A software license is a legal term regarding the use of or redistribution of software. Under copyright laws, all software is copyright protected. Software cannot be copyrighted if it’s 
        made by the US government, or if it’s in the Public Domain. Properties can be entered into the Public Domain by the creator, but they’re automatically put in after a certain period. 
        Public Domain applies to historical works such as the Mona Lisa, and to properties with expired copyrights, such as The Great Gatsby. Interpretations and rereleases of these works can 
        be copyrighted and commercialized in and of themselves, but the original source material can never be copyrighted again.</p>

    <p>There are many kinds of Copyright and Licenses. As for Software Licenses, they have many all to their own. Depending on the license, the consumer is allowed different rights on what they 
        can and cannot do with their product. For example, the original DOOM demo was shareware, meaning that it could be shared among users for free. The full game cost money and could not be 
        shared. In another case, documents made using Microsoft Office Software are free to share, but money cannot directly be made off of them. In some of the most strict cases, unauthorized 
        use of licensed music often warrants an immediate copyright strike by the copyright holder.  </p>

    <p>From the strictest case of not allowing footage of the software to the free distribution of shareware, different licenses afford different leniencies to consumers. For example, Documents 
        made using Microsoft Office Software are free to share, but money cannot directly be made off of them. </p>

    <p>     It's launch day, and you've finally completed your product. It's fully licensed and published, so now the money comes in. Time to sit back and relax? No! Well, kind of.
        Be proud of yourself and your team. You've done something not many have. You've finalized a commercial product, but you can't rest on your laurels. 
        You've met the deadline, but is your program bug-free? Is it as good as it can be? If not, you're expected to release an update to fix any issues with it.
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li><H2>Patches and Bug Fixes:</H2><h3>This isn't 1980, so any bugs that shipped with the final product are to be squashed. These bug-fixing updates are usually referred to as 'patches'. 
        Patches are usually small, under-the-hood style updates. They may fix only a few bugs or hundreds. Documentation of these patches, and most updates for that matter, are known as Patch Notes.
        Patch Notes are lists of changes made by an update, usually just bugsquashing.</h3>

        <h3>Patch Notes are highly recommended, both for the developers and  especially the consumers. Developers want to know what work's been done and what still needs to be done.
        But patch Notes are really for the consumers. If there's any drastic changes made by the update, then long-time users would like to know exactly what's different.
        It also shows to consumers that you're willing to interact with users. </h3></li>

            <li><H2>Content Updates and Improvements:</H2><h3>Besides bugs, there might be features you or your company would like to add post-launch. 
        Updates that add new content and features for your program are a good way to drum up interest for your project. They're a nice reward for long-time users and a way to draw in new users.
        Some updates are larger or smaller than others.</h3>

        <h3> Updates are usually titled in a specific way. The initial launch is known as version 1.0. The first large update would be called 1.1. A smaller update later would add a third number, 1.1.1.
            A second large update would be titled 1.2.0. These numbers can increase as far as you want to, but rarely do they reach 2.0. A 2.0 update is something special, 
            it's a show-offy sort of thing that says the project has changed so significantly since launch that it's essentially something new entirely.
