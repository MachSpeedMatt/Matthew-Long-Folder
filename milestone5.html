        <p>     It's launch day, and you've finally completed your product. It's fully licensed and published, so now the money comes in. Time to sit back and relax? No! Well, kind of.
            Be proud of yourself and your team. You've done something not many have. You've finalized a commercial product, but you can't rest on your laurels. 
            You've met the deadline, but is your program bug-free? Is it as good as it can be? If not, you're expected to release an update to fix any issues with it.
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li><H2>Patches and Bug Fixes:</H2><h3>This isn't 1980, so any bugs that shipped with the final product are to be squashed. These bug-fixing updates are usually referred to as 'patches'. 
            Patches are usually small, under-the-hood style updates. They may fix only a few bugs or hundreds. Documentation of these patches, and most updates for that matter, are known as Patch Notes.
            Patch Notes are lists of changes made by an update, usually just bugsquashing.</h3>
    
            <h3>Patch Notes are highly recommended, both for the developers and  especially the consumers. Developers want to know what work's been done and what still needs to be done.
            But patch Notes are really for the consumers. If there's any drastic changes made by the update, then long-time users would like to know exactly what's different.
            It also shows to consumers that you're willing to interact with users. </h3></li>
    
                <li><H2>Content Updates and Improvements:</H2><h3>Besides bugs, there might be features you or your company would like to add post-launch. 
            Updates that add new content and features for your program are a good way to drum up interest for your project. They're a nice reward for long-time users and a way to draw in new users.
            Some updates are larger or smaller than others.</h3>
    
            <h3> Updates are usually titled in a specific way. The initial launch is known as version 1.0. The first large update would be called 1.1. A smaller update later would add a third number, 1.1.1.
                A second large update would be titled 1.2.0. These numbers can increase as far as you want to, but rarely do they reach 2.0. A 2.0 update is something special, 
                it's a show-offy sort of thing that says the project has changed so significantly since launch that it's essentially something new entirely.
